	<h2>Struggling with getting your company up and running? We can help.</h2>
	<h3 id="p">Here at NPO, we understand the struggles of starting a company and having to find a web developer. That's why we started our company. So we can help you with that. We match programmer volunteers with start-up companies to get them off the ground. This way, we offer internships and help companies, all at once. It's a win win!</h3>
